// I am learning how to build strings using variables. This requires the use of the + operator.
// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Santana";
var myStr ="My name is  " + myName + " I am Doing great";
